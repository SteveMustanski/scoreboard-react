# scoreboard-react

The application consists of a scoreboard that allows for tracking player scores and a stopwatch if needed.

Users can add/remove users, increment and decrement scores, start/stop/reset at stop watch, and view stats for total players and total points.  The application also puts a crown icon next to the high scorer.

The application was built using React with an intent of practicing several react concepts.

The application is deployed on Heroku and you can [test it out here](https://gentle-ravine-75929.herokuapp.com/).
